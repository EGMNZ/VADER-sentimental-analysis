# Using VADER for Sentimental Analysis
In this project, Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoner (VADER) is used to show its effectiveness at providing sentimental analysis on a textual review. 

#### Project Objective 
The main purpose of this small project is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the VADER model on unlabeled text data for classifying sentiment. The goal of the project is to take a textual review and apply it to the VADER model, which is a trained lexicon from Natural Language ToolKit (NLTK). Using VADER can be useful in various use cases such as product reviews or on social media text where sentimental analysis is required.
